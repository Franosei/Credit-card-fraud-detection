After train our model with unbalanced train data we had the following as precision and recal with confusion matrix for both validation data and test data

---------------------------------------
  precision       |  Recall            |
---------------------------------------
0.9995786368903402|0.9997892740490991  |
---------------------------------------

confusion matrix for validation data
    ------------------------------------
1   |       5.0   |      5.0            |
    ------------------------------------
0   |      40.0   |     28315.0         |
    -------------------------------------
            1                   0       
            
confusion matrix for test data
    ------------------------------------
1   |     14.0      |      8.0           |
    ------------------------------------
0   |     43.0     |     28255.0         |
    -------------------------------------            
            1                  0                   
                  
recall for correctly classifying as fraud was 0.0007 for the test 

We could observe that our model is learning the the most frequent class. That is the model predict all class as non fraud.



Now we tried to apply sampling techniques to address this issue. In this problem we worked with spark dataframe.

Here we tried to use the undersampling method ro deal with the unbalance dataset.

We undersampled the class 1 and used as our training data.
Evaluation was done on the test set which gives as the following output

---------------------------------------
  precision       |  Recall            |
---------------------------------------
 0.999889770723104|0.9609110169491526  |
---------------------------------------


confusion matrix for test data
    ------------------------------------
1   |    42.0        |    1107.0        |
    ------------------------------------
0   |     3 .0       |     27213.0      |
    -------------------------------------            
            1                   0    
            
confusion matrix for test data
    ------------------------------------
1   |      52.0     |      1156.0       |
    ------------------------------------
0   |      5.0      |     27107.0       |
    -------------------------------------            
            1                   0         

test recall for 1.0 is 0.9007633587786259

Thus we were able to correctly classify 90% of our test as fraud which shows a maximum improvement as compared with working with the unbalanced data

Note: before you apply machine learning for classification problem, first check if your data s balanced or not
